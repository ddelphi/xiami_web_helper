## overview

This is a xiami web helper script for fast favoriting artist and song while you are in the xiami player page.


## usage

There are some functions you can use:

	* favorite artist with tags
	* favorite song with tags
	* one click song's more button (the icon that has circle with 3 dots) to open the dialog of adding to collection

And, there are some visual changes in the page:

	* the buttons in the top right corner will be removed
	* an artist name with green color indicates that it has been favorited (restrict to the current playing song)


## notice

[1]
Because the xiami site using its own script loading technique, that will cause the new added script will be loaded twice.

But it will not affect the function of the script.
